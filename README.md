### Current Employer & Experience

*Wake Forest University (2012 - Present)*

#### Principal Software Engineer (2023 - Present)
*University Advancement, ADS, Advancement Information Technology (AIT)*

  * Lead the creation of strategic, sustainable technical solutions for business operations, including the evaluation and integration of
  AI-assisted development tools and multi-agent workflow systems.
  * Lead the exploration, implementation and oversight of all UA infrastructure and code in AWS that isn't managed by IS.
  * Designed and built multi-agent systems using Claude Code, developing reusable architectural patterns including coordinator/worker
  hierarchies, parameterized agents, and automated serial/parallel workflow orchestration across 16+ repositories. Established design principles
  such as the 10-step rule for agent scope, context-agnostic agent design, and bottom-up validation loops.
  * Developed structured prompt engineering methodologies grounded in software engineering principles (Single Responsibility, DRY, separation of
  concerns). Discovered that explicitly defining success criteria — rather than just task steps — dramatically improved AI reliability, driving
  agent compliance from 25% to 100%.
  * Created automated batch workflows that reduced multi-week manual testing and tracking processes to days by delegating detail management to AI
   agents while retaining human oversight of strategy and decision-making.
  * Developed a systematic quality evaluation framework (Clear, Concise, Precise) for AI workflow instructions, assessing and improving ~60
  instruction files across three quality tiers (Good, Excellent, Exceptional) with reusable templates for coordinators, workers, and standards
  documents.
  * Provided technical leadership in software design and development activities for web applications; provide design reviews and give technical
  recommendations.
  * Ensured web software security/scalability, regulatory and University policy compliance (PCI, FERPA, Accessibility), audit standards;
  participate in risk assessments and mitigating activities.
  * Supported and facilitate the maintenance and upgrades of existing software applications.
  * Supported the whole software development life cycle (SDLC).
  * Ensured that all projects are of high-quality by fostering a culture of test driven development and encouraging usage of tools that evaluate
  code quality.
  * Mentored and trained software engineers on best practices, new technologies and advanced topics in web development, including practical AI
  integration, prompt engineering techniques, and model selection strategies.
  * Earned AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification (2025) through intensive self-directed study encompassing LLM architecture, NLP,
  embeddings, tokenization, neural networks, and model evaluation. Independently completed over 109 episodes of AI-focused podcasts and multiple
  training courses to build a comprehensive understanding of the AI landscape.
  * Completed a 9-part analytical series examining AI safety, alignment, and consciousness from a builder's perspective, contributing original
  observations about the gap between theoretical AI risk narratives and practical experience building reliable AI systems.
  * Recommended new technologies to help improve productivity.
  * Worked with teams to plan, prioritize, and complete project assignments using task management tools and agile/scrum methodologies.
  * Created CLI tools to improve the workflow for the team.
